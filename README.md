# CIT281 Project 1

## Overview

Project goals and outcomes:

1. Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders.
2. List the folders in a tree-like structure.
3. Use the ping command and practice using the break keyboard sequence.
4. Create and execute JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug.

## Deliverables

- `lab-01.zip`
- `p1-folders.png`
- `p1-tree.png`
- `p1-break.png`
- `p1-ping.png`
- `p1-date.js`
- `p1-random.js`

These files should be placed in your `cit281/p1` folder and zipped into `p1.zip`.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Completed Lab 1

1. Ensure you have completed Lab 1 and saved `lab-01.zip` in your `cit281/p1` folder.

### Part 2: Command line - folders

1. Use any combination of command line commands to create the specified folder structure.
2. Document the commands used by screen capturing the command line window and save the screen capture as `p1-folders.png` in your `p1` folder.
3. Save the output of the folder structure using `find` (Mac/Linux) or `tree` (Windows) commands and save it as `p1-tree.png`.

### Part 3: Command line - ping

1. Use the `ping` command to test the connection to `www.google.com`.
2. Document the attempt using screen capture, naming the file `p1-break.png` and saving the file in your `p1` folder.
3. Execute the `ping` command again with a limit of 5 packets and save the output as `p1-ping.png`.

### Part 4: JavaScript using Node.js and Visual Studio Code - day of the week

1. Create a JavaScript program (`p1-date.js`) to output the current day of the week.
2. Execute your program using the command line and VSCode.

### Part 5: JavaScript using Node.js and Visual Studio Code - random

1. Create a JavaScript program (`p1-random.js`) to output a random string of length between 5 and 25 characters.
2. Execute your program using the command line and VSCode.

### Project Deliverables

1. Create a compressed folder called `p1.zip` that contains the files from this project, including any lab deliverables.
2. The files to include in the zip are:
   - `lab-01.zip`
   - `p1-folders.png`
   - `p1-tree.png`
   - `p1-break.png`
   - `p1-ping.png`
   - `p1-date.js`
   - `p1-random.js`
